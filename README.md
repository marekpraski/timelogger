# timelogger
An easy to use pplication for logging your work time. Particularly useful if you frequently switch between tasks but need to keep track of your work in orther to accurately bill your customers.</br>
Define task groups, eg. clients you bill your work to: Company1, Company2 ...</br>
Define task definitions per task group, eg. coding, meeting ...</br>
Add optional additional detailed information to each running task. </br>
One-click start-stop logging work on a task.</br>
Auto-save log every hour.</br>
Each started task makes a separate log entry, so if you start coding for Company1 then have a meeting with Company2 and then resume coding for Company1, there will be three task log entries,
each with its time-stamp and optional detailed description. However they can then be aggregated, so you will get two billing entries: Company1-coding and Company2-meeting.</br>
View statistics: detailed break-down, aggregated by day or month. Export to csv.</br>
